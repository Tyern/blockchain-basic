## Aiming
✨ I am following the **"Build a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency | Full-Stack Edition"** course on Udemy to create this project.  
The aim of this project is to help me learn Node.js and gain a basic understanding of how a blockchain works behind the client interface.

## Description
✨ Here's a more detailed breakdown:  
1. This program creates a complete frontend React.js web application.  
2. Underneath, it builds a blockchain using an object-oriented programming approach.  
3. The blockchain code is implemented with a test suite.  
4. The main implementation focuses on key entities like **Block**, **Wallet**, **Transaction**, **Transaction Pool**, and more.  
5. The algorithm works seamlessly in a real-time peer-to-peer server with PubSub.

## Run Project
✨ Tested on MacOS, Node v14.21.2  

1. **Install dependencies**  
```bash
npm i
```
1. **Run the project**  
- In development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

- In deployment mode:
```bash
npm run start
```

Open the [localhost](localhost:3000) to get access to client interface.

1. For further testing and implement
```bash
npm run test
```
